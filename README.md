# mcell_build

This repository will contain all tools to clone repositories build a whole bundle.
The idea is to be able to clone just this repo, then run a single script 
that will clone or update all the required repositories, build everything that is necessary,
and assemble a blender bundle.
The resulting bundle will then be used in testing.
